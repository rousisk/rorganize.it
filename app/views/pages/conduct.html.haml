    %h2 Background & Reporting
    %p 
      A Code of Conduct was recently added to 
      %a{ href: "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/21292" } Rails. 
      As a project group, we were thrilled to see that this addition
      was met with numerous thumbs up from the community, and were
      inspired to add one ourselves. Our Code of Conduct is the same
      as theirs.
    %p
      To report an issue, please send us an
      %a{ href: "mailto:roar@rorganize.it" } email.
      We are here to help and want to make the rorganize community a
      wonderful and safe place.
